###Technical Requirements 

- Create an array with the following values: "NYC", "SF", "LA", "ATX", "SYD"; use the array to add values to the ```<select>``` menu by using a ```for``` loop in JavaScript (don't update the HTML to do this!)
- When the user changes the input of the drop-down, update the background image based on what they selected
- Use $.append() in your iteration on the drop-down menu 
- Use the ```$.attr()``` function to update html classes 
- Get the value of user input using ```$.val()```
- Use the ```$.change``` event handler to capture user actions
- You can use ```if/else if/else ``` conditionals to control the flow of your application OR even better use anonymous function
